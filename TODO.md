# To-Do
- Clean up logo
  - Looks alright, but I really just threw it together, and it could be better
  - Maybe try flat shapes rather than line-work, as shapes are more readable at small resolutions (such as avatars)
- Now playing update for new tracks
  - i.e. when a new track starts playing, update the previous notification or post a new one with the track name and
  duration
- Shuffle (potentially with range specified)
- `ping` latency
  - Potentially requires a `ShardManager`, which is potentially a lot of additional work for a latency measurement
- Age-restricted videos
- Persistent queue across leaves and joins within guild, inc. different voice channels
- Handle moves between voice channels
- Make `skip` display next playing
  - This would be done automatically if now playing is shown for new tracks
- Queue track lengths and total playback time
  - Not sure if this is worth doing - doing it in a way that looks decent involves making queue entries use a monospace
  font, and the only way to do that is by putting the queue in code blocks. This makes it look uglier, and removes the
  links
- Consider merging now playing and queue
- Move ready into closure in framework (`_ready`)
- Escaping doesn't work fully
  - Seems to be a Discord issue, not really sure of a solution other than just replacing all special characters with
  Unicode lookalikes (like I already do with square brackets)
- Checkup command for stats etc.
- Priority play (pp) to play something right now, ahead of the rest of the queue
  - Could play the new track as soon as the command is issued, but that would mean either skipping the current track or
  skipping and re-adding it - either way, much more complicated and not intuitive 
  - Could insert right after current track, which would allow the user to decide what to do with whatever is currently
  playing
- Support timestamped YouTube videos
- SponsorBlock integration
  - Filter out segments <5s long or something, since lavalink seeking takes a second
  - Probably shouldn't bother with previews/recaps and highlights
  - Maybe don't show a message when skipping, but show a readout of segments to skip on queueing a single track 
- Close Songbird connection on disconnect
- Set status
- Saved rolls for dice rolling (-sr?)
  - `saveroll` command for saving a roll command
  - Commands for querying/deleting saved rolls
  - Executing a saved roll simply calls `parse_roll_command`
  - `rr` or `runroll`
- Dice rolling do lots of individual rolls at once (for DMs)
- "New dice" command that does nothing
- Persistent storage
  - Probably SQLite with Diesel
  - Store the following data:
    - Previous status
    - User-saved rolls
      - Saved rolls should be saved to a user in a guild (so that if the bot is used in multiple DnD servers by the
      same users, the rolls are separate for their characters)
    - Queue(?)
- Separate function implementations for `roll`, so that the slash version can have the annotation as an optional
parameter
- Apparently it fails if no db.sqlite file is present
